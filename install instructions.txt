To create a new repository using GitHub Desktop:
=================================================
Only need to do this once
Easiest is the add a new Repository to a hard drive which creates blank directory
Make sure to select R option for the .gitignore, and create a GNU Licence GNU GPLv3
Then copy your R files into that directory
Then ignore secret and user.txt and all .files eg .DS_File
Commit to main using 'Initial Release' in the Summary
Then Push to 'Publish Repository' to GitHub.com, but keep it private as it is not a 'release'

Alternatively you can clone from Internet...


If you delete the local repository from your desktop and restore it using Finder..
===================================================================================
GitHub will tell you it is no longer a repository
The thing that makes it a repository is the .git/ directory so restore this and it becomes a respository again.

To create an initial Release using GitHub:
==========================================
Repository > View in GitHub to open it on the web
From the GitHub Web Page
To create a first GitHub release
Releases > Create a new release
Click on TARGET-UK-Plotter
Draft a new release
Tag e.g. 0.1b (b for beta)
Release title = animal name e.g. Ardvark
Description = First release of TARGET-Plotter which replaces OxTAR Plotter (Beta Release)
Publish Release
In the Settings > Danger Zone > change from Private to Public visibility
Change default brach from main to beta


To upload updates of TARGET Plotter to GitHub :
=================================================
Use GitHub Desktop which is really good
It tells you what files have changed - you need to commit to main with a description on what changed
Then push to GitHub
Via the GitHub app Open the repository page on your browser
Log into GitHub webpage and use Authenticator App code to get in e.g. FaceID etc

To download release to another install:
=======================================
Go to web GitHub and find the release e.g. Aardvark
Click on the name of the release to download the .zip
Copy in the user.txt and secret.txt
Run app.R and you are golden


To get Docker working on Synology
=============================
Go to WebStation and Web Service Portal
Look for Docker customised portal with hostname *, port - and alias oxtar
Its NOT a virtual host
Create Web Service Package Service Portal > Docker
Key bit - select Alias Portal
Alias = targetuk
No access control or error page configured

It should look like this:
Docker rocker-shiny-verse1
Name based
ouhradwiki.com
Https = 3838

Make sure in the Docker app on Synology you can go to bash and then check /srv/shiny-server/targetuk


To upload updates of TARGET to Bianchi :
=================================================
Copy files to bianchi/docker/shiny/updates folder
Might want to put whole lib/ or www/ dir in there

Get into Bianchi DSM
Click on Docker from the packages
Container > rocker-shiny-verse1 > Terminal > bash
Cd shiny
./installUpdates

The URL should then work if both alias set up in the portal and the directory and code exists on docker:
http://ouhradwiki.com/targetuk
